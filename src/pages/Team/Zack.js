                Hello, my name is Zachary Punsalang I'm a Computer Science major at University of Irvine 
                and I've been interested in Web Development through my college career. I've been told 
                that the Web is the most influential place and I want to be one of those
                people that can influence others. DiversityHotline is a perfect way 
                to help indivduals gain experience, learn, and be mentored about their
                situations. I've wanted to use my intrest in Web Development in creating this app as a Web apps
                so it portable, light weight, and usable to anyone in need. My contact email
                "zpunsala@uci.edu" if you have any questions.
