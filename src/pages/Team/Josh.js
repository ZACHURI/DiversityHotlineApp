                Greetings!  My name is Joshua Ma and I am founder and champion of 
                Diversity Hotline; an app and web based platform that strives to provide 
                an inclusive and safe space for all conversations. I am currently a junior 
                at UCI who is proudly double majoring in Chinese Studies and Political Science with a 
                minor in Civic and Community Engagement. Calling Southern California home, I am proud to 
                say that I too have experienced my list of unconscious biases that led me to feel insecucure 
                about my appearance and identity. My hope and dream is that one day, 
                Diversity Hotline will not only be a space to talk about such experiences but also have the 
                tools to prevent to educate and prevent such negative experiences from ever occuring.
