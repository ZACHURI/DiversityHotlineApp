                Hi there, my name is Art Punsalang, I am an enterprising student from the 
                University of Irvine California majoring in Information and Computer Science. 
                When the Diversity Hotline idea was introduced to me by Josh, it sounded like a 
                great idea that I believed in because there are many people who struggle with 
                indifference, discrimiation and inequality. Diversity Hotline is a great way for 
                people to get help and talk about those situations they are struggling with. 
                Overall,  Diversity Hotline is my first ever web application 
                that I have built and will be proud of how it will continuously grow for 
                futures to come. If you have any questions about Diversity Hotline or for me, my email is punsalaa@uci.edu.
