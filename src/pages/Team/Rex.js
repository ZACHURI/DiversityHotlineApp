                Hey! My name is Franchesca Leung and I'm a fourth year Computer Science major 
                at University of California, Irvine. I'm really happy to be a part of Diversity 
                Hotline and I'm extrememly proud of everything it stands for. I believe it is hard 
                to find the right resources or the right person to talk in times of need, but Diversity 
                Hotline is proud to provide both a safe space to share and wonderful resources. 
                I truly believe in the impact Diversity Hotline will have on its users, and I can't wait 
                for others to utilize what we've created as a team! 
                Feel free to reach out at faleung@uci.edu if there are any questions!
